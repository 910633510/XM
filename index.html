              <h4>Overview</h4>
              <p>
                xVoice Clone allows authorized XM clients to simulate
                voice-driven assistant interactions using customer-approved
                scripts and datasets. The app is designed for enterprise
                demonstration and evaluation purposes, and only collects the
                minimum data required to operate.
              </p>
              <h4>Information We Collect</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Account metadata (name, work email, organization) provided by
                  your XM engagement lead.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Audio samples recorded within the app when you choose to test
                  speech capture features.

                <li>
                  Diagnostic logs related to app stability and performance,
                  including device type and OS version.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h4>How We Use Information</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Authenticate users participating in approved pilots or
                  demonstrations.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Generate AI-driven voice responses based on the scripts and
                  datasets you provide.

                <li>
                  Improve reliability by monitoring crash reports and high-level
                  usage metrics.

              </ul>
              <h4>Data Sharing &amp; Retention</h4>
              <p>
                XM does not sell or broker personal data. Audio recordings and
                associated transcripts are stored in XM-managed environments
                aligned to your contract requirements and are retained no longer
                than 30 days unless your organization requests extended
                retention for testing. Crash analytics are processed through
                Apple-provided tooling and anonymized before internal review.
              </p>
