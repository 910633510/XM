Privacy Policy

Last updated: October 28, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how xvoice clone (“App”) by Xiayang Wang (“we,” “us,” “our”) handles personal information.

1) Who we are & contact

Developer: Xiayang Wang

Address: Bayside, NY

Email: 3687897322@qq.com

2) Data we collect

We do not collect, store, or share personal information from users of the App.

We do not create user accounts.

We do not track you or use the Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA).

We do not use analytics, crash-reporting, or advertising SDKs.

We do not request access to Contacts, Photos, Camera, Microphone, Location, Health, or other sensitive data.

3) Third parties

The App may interact with Apple’s systems (e.g., App Store, device services). Apple may process limited device information to deliver the App and system services under Apple’s own privacy policies. We do not control Apple’s processing.

4) Children’s privacy

The App is not directed to children under 13 (or the age required in your region). Since we do not collect data, we do not knowingly collect data from children.

5) Security

Because we do not collect or store personal information, there is no user data for us to secure on our servers.

6) Changes to this policy

If the App later adds features that collect data (for example, analytics, crash logs, or login), we will update this Policy and the App’s disclosures before those changes go live.

7) How to contact us

If you have questions, contact 3687897322@qq.com
