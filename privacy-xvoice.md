# xVoice Clone Privacy Policy

**Effective:** March 15, 2024  
**Next review:** September 2024

## Overview

xVoice Clone converts approved speech samples into secure synthetic voices. XM LLC safeguards customer data with strict segregation, encryption, and lifecycle controls that align to CJIS and HIPAA requirements.

## Data Collected

- Scripted recordings supplied by the customer and optional redaction dictionaries for sensitive phrases.
- Metadata describing the speaker’s role, approved scenarios, and distribution rights.
- No biometric markers beyond submitted audio are retained.

## Processing & Storage

- Audio is encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest (AES-256 with HSM-backed key rotation).
- Training workspaces are customer-specific and monitored with continuous logging.
- Raw recordings and temporary assets are destroyed within 14 days of delivering the synthetic voice.

## Security & Access

- Access requires multi-factor authentication and is restricted to personnel cleared for CJIS/HIPAA workloads.
- Playback, export, and handoff events are logged centrally and reviewed weekly.
- Synthetic fingerprints incorporate differential privacy noise to prevent reconstruction of original recordings.

## Customer Controls

- Clients approve scripts, retention windows, and downstream licensing before work begins.
- Emergency purge requests are fulfilled within 48 hours across hot and cold storage tiers.
- Final audit packets summarize inputs, processing steps, and verification tests for internal compliance.
