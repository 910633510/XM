App: XSIMPLE VPN

1. Introduction

XSIMPLE VPN (“we”, “our”, “the app”) is operated by Xiayang Wang.
Your privacy is extremely important. This policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and — equally important — what we do not collect.

2. Data We Do NOT Collect

As a VPN app, we strictly follow App Store Guideline 5.4 for VPN services.

We DO NOT collect, store, monitor, share, or sell:

Your browsing history

DNS queries

VPN traffic content

Destination IP addresses

Connection timestamps

Bandwidth usage

User identifiers related to VPN usage

In short: We do not log your VPN activity.

3. Data We Collect

We only collect the minimum data required to operate the app:

3.1. App Store Purchase Information

Apple may provide basic purchase data to allow:

Subscription validation

Refund verification

Restoring purchases

No payment information (card numbers, billing address) is ever seen by us.

3.2. Diagnostics (Optional)

If you choose to send crash logs through Apple’s system:

Crash reports

Performance metrics

These are anonymous and only used to improve app reliability.

4. How We Use the Data

The limited data we collect is used only to:

Provide the VPN service

Validate subscriptions (Apple StoreKit)

Improve app stability (crash logs)

We do NOT use data for:

Advertising

Tracking

Selling to third parties

Analytics beyond crash diagnostics

5. Sharing of Data

We do not share any personal or VPN activity data with third parties.

XSIMPLE VPN does not use advertising SDKs, tracking SDKs, or monetization networks.

6. Third-Party Services

XSIMPLE VPN only uses third-party services required for the app to function:

6.1 Apple In-App Purchase (StoreKit)

Used for subscription management.

6.2 Apple Crash Reporting (Optional)

Used to diagnose app crashes.

No other third-party SDKs are used.

7. Data Retention

Purchase-related data → kept only as required for tax/legal compliance.

Crash logs → kept by Apple for their standard retention period.

No VPN traffic logs exist, so nothing is retained.

You may request deletion of identifiable data by contacting:

XSIMPLE VPN is not intended for children under 13.
We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.
